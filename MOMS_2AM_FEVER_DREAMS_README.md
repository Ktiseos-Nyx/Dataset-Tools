10. **Pus pockets** - Infection celebration theme

## Key Design Principles

### Funky Button Shapes (CRITICAL!)
- **MUST** use irregular `border-radius` values for QPushButton
- Examples: `border-radius: 25px 45px 15px 60px;` (never symmetric!)
- Use CSS transforms like `rotate()` and `scale()` for extra chaos
- Each theme should have unique button shapes that match the theme concept

### Color Schemes
- Match colors to the theme concept (browns for poop, greens for infection, etc.)
- Use `qlineargradient` and `qradial-gradient` extensively
- Include hover and pressed states that enhance the theme

### Required QSS Elements
Each theme needs styling for:
- `QWidget` (base)
- `QMainWindow` (main gradient)
- `QPushButton` + hover/pressed states
- `QLineEdit`, `QTextEdit`, `QPlainTextEdit` + focus states
- `QTabWidget::pane` and `QTabBar::tab` + selected states
- `QScrollBar:vertical` and handle states
- `QMenuBar` and `QMenu` + selected states
- `QStatusBar`
- Custom `QLabel` elements with theme-specific IDs

## File Naming Convention
`moms_2am_[theme_name].qss` where theme_name uses underscores instead of spaces.

Examples:
- `moms_2am_cradle_cap.qss`
- `moms_2am_animal_house_food_fight.qss`

## Location
All files go in: `dataset_tools/themes/KTISEOS_NYX_THEMES/`

## TODO List Remaining

### 1. Complete the 10 Missing Themes
Create QSS files for each remaining theme with funky button shapes and appropriate color schemes.

### 2. Easter Egg Unlock Mechanism
- Add a secret unlock sequence for the chaos collection
- Suggest: Konami code or typing "chaos" in a hidden field
- Should be discoverable but not obvious

### 3. Warning Dialog for Chaos Themes
Create a popup warning when user selects chaos themes with this exact content:

```
‚ö†Ô∏è CHAOS COLLECTION WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è

You are about to enter Mom's 2AM Fever Dreams Collection.
This theme collection contains mature content that may cause:

‚Ä¢ Uncontrollable laughter
‚Ä¢ Questioning of your life choices
‚Ä¢ Sudden urge to call your mother
‚Ä¢ Permanent changes to your theme preferences
‚Ä¢ Loss of innocence regarding UI design
‚Ä¢ Spontaneous snorting while using the application

Content Warning: These themes were conceived during a late-night 
Marvel Snap session and contain references to bodily functions, 
medical conditions, and general chaos.

Are you 18+ or mentally prepared for this journey?

[BRING ON THE CHAOS] [I'M TOO PURE FOR THIS]
```

- Include checkbox: "Don't show this warning again (for the brave)"
- Make it a proper modal dialog that blocks interaction
- Store user preference in settings

### 4. Add Collection to Theme Manager
- Integrate the collection into the existing theme management system
- Create a separate "Chaos Collection" category
- Add preview functionality if possible
- Ensure themes can be applied and switched properly

## Creative Guidelines

### Theme-Specific Concepts
- **Cradle cap**: Yellow/brown crusty textures, baby bottle shapes
- **Skid mark**: Brown streaks, underwear elastic borders
- **Animal house food fight**: Splattered food colors, cafeteria tray shapes
- **Cat scratch fever**: Red scratch marks, claw-shaped borders
- **Frostbite toes**: Blue/purple ice crystals, toe-shaped buttons
- **Necrosis nose**: Black/gray decay, medical equipment shapes
- **Old people skin**: Wrinkled textures, age spot patterns
- **Curdled milk**: Chunky white/yellow, cottage cheese textures
- **Lactating lady nugs**: Pink/white milk themes, nursing shapes
- **Pus pockets**: Yellow/green infection, bubble textures

### CSS Creativity Examples
```css
/* Example funky button shape */
QPushButton {
    border-radius: 35px 12px 50px 8px; /* Irregular! */
    transform: rotate(-7deg); /* Tilted chaos */
}

/* Example themed gradient */
background: qradial-gradient(ellipse at 30% 70%, #color1 20%, #color2 60%, #color3 90%);
```

## Implementation Notes
- Each theme should feel completely different
- Comments at the top should be humorous and match the theme
- Include fake "legal disclaimers" in comments
- Use semantic naming for custom QLabel IDs
- Test that all UI elements are readable and functional

## Collection Philosophy
This collection represents the beautiful chaos of 2AM creativity. Each theme should be:
- Visually distinctive
- Functionally complete
- Hilariously inappropriate
- Technically impressive
- A testament to CSS creativity gone wild

## Final Integration
Once all themes are complete:
1. Test each theme individually
2. Verify the easter egg unlock works
3. Confirm warning dialog functionality
4. Ensure smooth integration with theme manager
5. Document any known issues or limitations

**Remember: The goal is controlled chaos with maximum visual impact and humor!** üé®üíÄ‚ú®

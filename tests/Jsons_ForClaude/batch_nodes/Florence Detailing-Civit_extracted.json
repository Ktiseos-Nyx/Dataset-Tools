To pick between them, simply bypass the one you aren't using, and route the \"image\" *output* widget of the one you *are* using to the top reroute (the blue card-shaped one.)\n\nYou may want to do multiple passes for different targets for whatever reason. To do so, just copy this group, route the Basic Pipe widget from whichever Detailer Pipe node is currently active to the one you'll be using next. You can use the other two Reroutes are provided for convenience; Mask on top (purple), SEGS on bottom (cyan.)"

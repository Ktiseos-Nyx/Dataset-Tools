I recommend you do that.\n\nFlux doesn't use the negative prompt but the other two do, so it's included. \n\nI like the low step generation in flux to get a rough composition. 1-3 steps usually, depending on the subject matter. I think flux way over-bakes the content at 20 steps, pulling them away from compositions that I preferred at those lower steps. 1 step will give rougher and more distressed results, and up to 4 steps will have better text generation and less noise.\n\nSD3 does a great job of adding detail and refining the rough composition in the Flux generation.\n\nSDXL-turbo is fast enough for a quick ULTIMATE upscale. Lightning might be your flavor there, or even a SDXL community model. I like RealVis XL V3 Turbo.\n\n* Feel free to bypass the LoRAs and swap to your favorite upscalers."

Head over to Civitai and grab some baked Checkpoint s. Make sure you read the instructions on what to set the steps at! Thirdly, read all the notes before you begin. This might save you some frustration.\nOr, visit a youtube video where I go over all this: Youtube Video Instructions: https://youtu.be/fCD8H6i78Gc"

You'll notice that style exists both above and to the right.  I think it is a good idea to pick one or the other, not both. But maybe some cool effects if you did do two?  Try it and see!\n\nTo the right is the LoRaStacker.  Get some Flux lora's from Civitai and put them in your loras folder.  Refresh, restart the server, and you can select them.  Make sure you enable the switch and look at the details on Civitai for the weights that have the best results. Also if any loras have trigger words, don't forget to include them in the prompts."

There are work flows that have some pretty intense upscale that you could simply drop your existing images into and run them through.  I am still looking for one I like.

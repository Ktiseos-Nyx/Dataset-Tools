The question_text asks for a demonstration of these colors applied to arm skin, which suggests the user wants to see how the shades translate from the palette to a real-world application.  \n\nTo address this, I would consider swatching each color on the arm in a neat and organized manner, ensuring the shades are clearly visible and easily distinguishable. The swatches should be applied in a way that highlights the texture and pigmentation of each color, such as using a clean brush or directly from the palette.  \n\nThe answer_image would likely display the arm with swatches of each color arranged in a grid or row, showing the exact shades and finishes (matte, shimmer, glitter, etc.). The lighting should be bright and even to accurately represent the colors. This approach ensures the user can visually compare the palette's colors to their application on skin.\n</think>"

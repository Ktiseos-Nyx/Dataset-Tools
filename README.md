A script that in theory works to help you visualize your dataset, edit text. I'm aware i'm not the only one to make something like this, and i don't have anyone's code to go by other than what GPT gave me.  I am inspired by clearly my peers around me in Civitai, and i'm just trying to learn how to make tools to help the community!

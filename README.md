<hr>

Dataset-Tools is a desktop application designed to help users browse and manage their image and text datasets, particularly those used with AI art generation tools like Stable Diffusion. Developed using PyQt6, it provides a simple and intuitive graphical interface for browsing images, viewing metadata, and examining associated text prompts. As of recently this has also extended it's use case to reading metadata from LoRa safetensor file formats, as well as reading metadata from sites such as [Civitai](https://civitai.com/). This project is inspired by tools within the AI art community (‚òÆÔ∏è[receyuki](https://github.com/receyuki/stable-diffusion-prompt-reader)ü§ç) and aims to empower users in improving their dataset curation workflow. If you're interested in getting involved, feel free to fork and contribute!

## How to Use Dataset-Tools

### Requirements

To run the program, you will need the following software:

#### Python:
- [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or [Try `uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)

UV Is available and useable on Linux, Windows and MacOS, it's extremely fast and written in rust! 

#### Python Versions:
- Requires at least Python 3.10, older versions may not react well with the installation commands.  You'll also note that certain Ubuntu systems may not install the required packages correctly, if you're having problems with this follow the guide below, or let us know in the issues section above!

####  Git:
- [Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)
- [MacOS first option](https://git-scm.com/downloads/mac), [or second option](https://brew.sh/)
- [Linux](https://git-scm.com/downloads/linux)

##### Non Required Extensions - FISH SHELL

This is a MAJOR quality of life tool to make it easier on your eyeballs! [Fish shell](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell) gives you some extra security and quality of life with colors and extensions to your terminal!

- macOS
fish can be installed:

using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/): 
```bash
brew install fish
```
using [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/): 
```bash
sudo port install fish
```
using [the installer from fishshell.com](https://fishshell.com/)
as a [standalone app from fishshell.com](https://fishshell.com/)
Note: The minimum supported macOS version is 10.10 "Yosemite".

- Packages for Linux
Packages for Debian, Fedora, openSUSE, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux/CentOS are available from the [openSUSE Build Service](https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=shells%3Afish&package=fish)
Packages for Ubuntu are available from the [fish PPA](https://launchpad.net/~fish-shell/+archive/ubuntu/release-3), and can be installed using the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:fish-shell/release-3
sudo apt update
sudo apt install fish
```
Instructions for other distributions may be found at [fishshell.com](https://fishshell.com/).

- Windows

On Windows 10/11, fish can be installed under the WSL Windows Subsystem for Linux with the instructions for the appropriate distribution listed above under ‚ÄúPackages for Linux‚Äù, or from source with the instructions below.

fish (4.0 on and onwards) cannot be installed in Cygwin, due to a lack of Rust support.


##### Installation on Linux (Ubuntu/Debian) Systems under 22.04

Currently the PYQT6 environment tools are standard on these systems:

* Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa)

* Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)

* Ubuntu 23.04 (Lunar Lobster) and other non-LTS releases

If you are below that and you're receiving errors on installing PYQT6 please follow this guide which does seem difficult, but we'll work on figuring out how to make it work for you asap! 

This package requires Qt6 development libraries to be installed. On Ubuntu/Debian systems, you can typically install them using one of the following methods:

**Method 1 (Recommended):**

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install qt6-base-dev qt6-tools-dev
```
**Method 2 If method 1 fails:**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install qt6-default
```

After installing the necessary packages, ensure that the path to either qmake or qt6-qmake is in your system's $PATH environment variable. You can use the commands 
```bash
which qmake
```

or 

```bash
which qt6-qmake 
```

to see if they are installed and find their locations. If neither exist you can install them using the commands above. If the tools exist but are not in your path you can add the path to your environment using a command such as

```bash
export PATH="/usr/lib/qt6/bin:$PATH" 
```

(replace /usr/lib/qt6/bin with the location returned by the which command used above).

#### VENV Instructions

It's customary for safety and sanity to use a Virtual environment! Trust me on this one, multiple python installations is always a mess and a half! 

* If you're wanting to use a VENV via main python, you can set one up this way:

```bash
python3 -m venv <env_name>
source <env_name>/bin/activate
pip install .
```

* If you're wanting to use a VENV via main UV, you can set one up this way :

Python 3.12 Example

```bash
$ uv venv
Using Python 3.12.3
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate
```

* If you're wanting to activate it and you have FISH?
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate.fish
```


### Launching the Application

#### 1. Open your ``terminal`` shell console of choice.üê£  (ie:  ```powershell```,```cmd```,```zsh```,```bash```, etc.)

#### 2. ``git clone`` or download the Dataset-Tools repository from GitHub.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Ktiseos-Nyx/Dataset-Tools.git
```

#### 3. Move into Dataset-Tools folder and `pip install`the required dependencies:

```sh
cd Dataset-Tools
pip install .
```

> [!NOTE]
> `uv` users
> ```sh
> cd Dataset-Tools
> uv pip install .
> ```

#### 4. Run the application with `dataset-tools` command:

```sh
dataset-tools
```

#### You're in!

### User Interface Overview
<hr>

The application window has the following main components:

*   **Current Folder:** Displays the path of the currently loaded folder.
*   **Open Folder:** A button to select a folder containing images and text files.
*   **Image List:** Displays a list of images and text files found in the selected folder.
*   **Image Preview:** An area to display a selected image.
*   **Metadata Box:** A text area to display the extracted metadata from the selected image or safetensors file (including Stable Diffusion prompt, settings, etc.).

### Managing Images and Text

*   **Selecting Images:** Click on an image or text file in the list to display its preview, metadata, and associated text content.
*   **Viewing Metadata:** Metadata associated with the selected image is displayed on the text area, such as steps, samplers, seeds, and more.
*   **Viewing Text:** The content of any text file associated with the selected image is displayed on the text box.


## Key Features

*   **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Built with PyQt6 for a modern and cross-platform experience.
*   **Image Previews:** Quickly view images in a dedicated preview area.
*   **Metadata Extraction:** Extract and display relevant metadata from PNG image files, especially those generated from Stable Diffusion. Now including support for Safetensors files, please note this at the moment includes LoRA, and NOT Embeddings. This at the moment also includes for support beyond SDXL base models, as well as Flux, Aura, SD3 and more to come! We've also recently added support for images from [Civitai](https://civitai.com/), supporting their EXIF formats! 
*   **Text Viewing:** Display the content of text files.
*   **Clear Layout:** A simple and intuitive layout, with list view on the left, and preview on the right.

## Future Developments

*   **Filtering/Sorting:** Options to filter and sort files.
*   **Thumbnail Generation:** Implement thumbnails for faster browsing.
*   **Themes:** Introduce customizable themes for appearance.
*   **Better User Experience:** Test on different operating systems and screen resolutions to optimize user experience.
*   **Video Tutorials:** Create video tutorials to show users how to use the program.
*   **Text Tutorials:** Create detailed tutorials in text and image to show the user how to use the program.

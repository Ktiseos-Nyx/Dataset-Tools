# Dataset-Tools
A script that in theory works to help you visualize your dataset, edit text. 

A script that in theory works to help you visualize your dataset, edit text. I'm aware i'm not the only one to make something like this, and i don't have anyone's code to go by other than what GPT gave me.  I am inspired by clearly my peers around me in Civitai, and i'm just trying to learn how to make tools to help the community!

## Overview of themes

Beetlejuice Inspired

Light Theme

Dark Theme

Pastel V2

There was a Pastel V1, but it broke.

There are SEVERAL commented themes in the code, i'm fixing text on those later.

Night Sky

Fire Red

Sunset Orange

Lavender

Ocean Blue

Mint 

Forest Green

If you'd like other color themes added, let me know - they're not hard to impliment, they're just hex codes and HTML/CSS - it's just the commented out ones have some issues I need to sort out with text colors - Later on i'll fix that, just I wanna get this pushed to main!

## Changelog

Started with Tkinter Gui, but moved to PYQT6.

Realized it needed more to it. 

Added gallery, text editing, image preview.

Text box list.

Save, Close and Select Image. 

Commented out themes that don't work. 

Tried to add an icon.

Fixing aspect ratio is ... well i'm on a retina 5k screen, so go figure. - This is because if you select a TALLER image it'll break and you can't close it or edit the text, i'm working on it.

The OLDER file in this specific repo, as i'm finally merging to main will give you back some stuff btue the images are tiny. 

Indentation issues are fixed. 

### What the OLD FILE Looks like - and that's ok!

## Coming Soon

Video tutorial via youtube.

Tutorial in text, images.

Fixing themes where the text is just attrocious. That's my fault, sorry.

When we're out of MAIN development mode, i want to try and get this as a homebrew cask, and figure out how to all that - we're just not ready yet.

Get people to test it on different OS boxes, so we can decide WHAT sizing is best.

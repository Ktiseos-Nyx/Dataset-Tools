Dataset-Tools is a desktop application designed to help users browse and manage their image and text datasets, particularly those used with AI art generation tools like Stable Diffusion. Developed using PyQt6, it provides a simple and intuitive graphical interface for browsing images, viewing metadata, and examining associated text prompts. This project is inspired by tools within the AI art community (☮️[receyuki](https://github.com/receyuki/stable-diffusion-prompt-reader)🤍) and aims to empower users in improving their dataset curation workflow.

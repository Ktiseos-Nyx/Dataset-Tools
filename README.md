Dataset-Tools is a desktop application designed to help users browse and manage their image and text datasets, particularly those used with AI art generation tools like Stable Diffusion. Developed using PyQt6, it provides a simple and intuitive graphical interface for browsing images, viewing metadata, and examining associated text prompts. As of recently this has also extended it's use case to reading metadata from LoRa safetensor file formats, as well as reading metadata from sites such as [Civitai](https://civitai.com/). This project is inspired by tools within the AI art community (‚òÆÔ∏è[receyuki](https://github.com/receyuki/stable-diffusion-prompt-reader)ü§ç) and aims to empower users in improving their dataset curation workflow. If you're interested in getting involved, feel free to fork and contribute!

<hr>

## How this Differs from Other Tools:

Unlike other metadata readers, this tool is designed to be fully up-to-date with Python 3.12 and above, while maintaining compatibility with Python 3.10. It extends beyond basic image metadata, offering robust support for `safetensors` files commonly used in models and checkpoints across diverse AI platforms like Stable Diffusion, Aura, and Flux. Furthermore, it incorporates specific readers for ComfyUI and Automatic1111 EXIF data, as well as non-AI related metadata, and we are working to improve user customizability with more color themes. Our aim is to provide a simple, user-friendly tool that is easily verifiable for accuracy and ease of use.

### Intersectionality üíñ‚ú®üåà

*   üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è The development of this app is driven by individuals who are either neurodivergent, or who actively support neurodiversity. We're also a team that identifies with, or actively supports the LGBTQIA2S+ community. Ktiseos Nyx is run by Earth & Dusk, which is a project run by a community of amazing and welcoming people.

*   ‚ú®üß†‚ôæÔ∏è Neurodivergence encompasses so much more than just Autism & ADHD. Whatever your specific form of neurodivergence may be, you are wholeheartedly welcome here.

*   ü¶ÑüöÄüí´ As the creator of this project (duskfallcrew), I personally navigate life with CPTSD, DID, Autism, & ADHD, and the buck doesn't stop there. While I've utilized LLMs at various stages of this project's development, this is not the end all be all, and whatever your insights, ideas, or contributions may be, you're welcome to be heard, and to contribute.

## How to Use Dataset-Tools

### Requirements

To run the program, you will need the following software:

#### Python:

*   [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or  [Try `uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) (Optional)

*   Requires at least Python 3.10; older versions may not react well with the installation commands.

*  You'll also note that certain Ubuntu systems may not install the required packages correctly. If you're having problems with this, please follow the guide below, or let us know in the issues section above!

*  `uv` is available and usable on Linux, Windows, and macOS. It's extremely fast and written in rust! It is also optional.

#### Git:

*   [Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)
*   [MacOS first option](https://git-scm.com/downloads/mac), [or second option](https://brew.sh/)
*   [Linux](https://git-scm.com/downloads/linux)

<hr>

#### Installation on Linux (Ubuntu/Debian) Systems

<hr>

This section provides instructions on how to install the necessary tools for PyQt6 on Linux systems.

**Supported Ubuntu Versions**

The PyQt6 environment tools are typically included by default in these Ubuntu versions and newer:

*   Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa)
*   Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)
*   Ubuntu 23.04 (Lunar Lobster), and other non-LTS releases

**If You're on an Older Version of Ubuntu**

If you are using an older version of Ubuntu or Debian than those listed above, you might encounter errors when trying to install PyQt6. If you see errors related to PyQt6, please follow the steps below to install the required Qt6 development libraries.

**Installation Steps**

To install the necessary Qt6 development tools, use one of the following methods:

**Method 1 (Recommended):**

1.  **Update your package list:**

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    ```

2.  **Install Qt6 development tools:**

    ```bash
    sudo apt install qt6-base-dev qt6-tools-dev
    ```

**Method 2 (If Method 1 Fails):**

1.  **Update your package list:**

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    ```

2.  **Install the default Qt6 packages:**

    ```bash
    sudo apt install qt6-default
    ```

**Verify Installation**

After installing the Qt6 libraries, you need to check if the `qmake` or `qt6-qmake` command is available on your system. Here's how:

1.  **Check for `qmake` or `qt6-qmake`:**

    Open your terminal and run the following commands one at a time:

    ```bash
    which qmake
    ```
    or

    ```bash
    which qt6-qmake
    ```

2.  **If `qmake` or `qt6-qmake` is NOT found:** This means that you have not installed `qmake` yet and should run the `sudo apt install` commands above.

3.  **If `qmake` or `qt6-qmake` is found:** This means that the tool is installed, but is not currently in your path. You can add it to your path by using the following command:

    ```bash
    export PATH="/usr/lib/qt6/bin:$PATH"
    ```

    **Important:** You might need to change `/usr/lib/qt6/bin` to the actual location of `qmake` or `qt6-qmake` on your system (returned from the `which` command).

**Note**: Please copy and paste each command individually and execute them one by one.

Then, you can install the package using pip within a virtual environment:

```bash
      python3 -m venv <env_name>
      source <env_name>/bin/activate
      pip install .
```
### Launching the Application

<hr>

#### 1. Open your terminal shell console of choice.üê£ (ie: ``powershell``, ``cmd``, ``zsh``, ``bash``, etc.)

####VENV Instructions

It's customary for safety and sanity to use a Virtual environment! Trust me on this one, multiple python installations is always a mess and a half! 

* If you're wanting to use a VENV via main python, you can set one up this way:

```bash
python3 -m venv <env_name>
source <env_name>/bin/activate
pip install .
```

* If you're wanting to use a VENV via main UV, you can set one up this way :

Python 3.12 Example

```bash
uv venv .venv
Using Python 3.12.3
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Activate with: source .venv/bin/activate
```

* If you're wanting to activate it and you have FISH?
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate.fish
```

#### 2. ``git clone`` or download the Dataset-Tools repository from GitHub.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Ktiseos-Nyx/Dataset-Tools.git
```

#### 3. Move into Dataset-Tools folder and `pip install`the required dependencies:

```sh
cd Dataset-Tools
pip install .
```

> [!NOTE]
> `uv` users
> ```sh
> cd Dataset-Tools
> uv pip install .
> ```

#### 4. Run the application with `dataset-tools` command:

```sh
dataset-tools
```

#### You're in!

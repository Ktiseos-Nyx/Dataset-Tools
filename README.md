# Dataset-Tools: Enhancing Dataset Visualization and Text Editing
Dataset-Tools is a versatile script designed to assist in visualizing datasets and editing associated text files. Developed using PyQt6, it provides an intuitive graphical interface for managing images and their corresponding annotations. Inspired by tools within the Civitai community, this project aims to empower users in enhancing their dataset management capabilities.

You're more than welcome to help develop this tool, I am not really a programmer, I am aware of this - I am doing tiny things with Chat GPT to further help my community!

## Changelog

Started with Tkinter Gui, but moved to PYQT6.

Realized it needed more to it. 

Added gallery, text editing, image preview.

Text box list.

Save, Close and Select Image. 

Commented out themes that don't work. 

Tried to add an icon.

Fixing aspect ratio is ... well i'm on a retina 5k screen, so go figure. - This is because if you select a TALLER image it'll break and you can't close it or edit the text, i'm working on it.

The OLDER file in this specific repo, as i'm finally merging to main will give you back some stuff btue the images are tiny. 

Indentation issues are fixed. 

### What the OLD FILE Looks like - and that's ok!

## Coming Soon

Video tutorial via youtube.

Tutorial in text, images.

Fixing themes where the text is just attrocious. That's my fault, sorry.

When we're out of MAIN development mode, i want to try and get this as a homebrew cask, and figure out how to all that - we're just not ready yet.

Get people to test it on different OS boxes, so we can decide WHAT sizing is best.

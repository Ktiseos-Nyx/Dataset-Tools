# Dataset-Tools
A script that in theory works to help you visualize your dataset, edit text. 

A script that in theory works to help you visualize your dataset, edit text. I'm aware i'm not the only one to make something like this, and i don't have anyone's code to go by other than what GPT gave me.  I am inspired by clearly my peers around me in Civitai, and i'm just trying to learn how to make tools to help the community!

## Coming Soon

Video tutorial via youtube.

Tutorial in text, images.

Fixing themes where the text is just attrocious. That's my fault, sorry.

When we're out of MAIN development mode, i want to try and get this as a homebrew cask, and figure out how to all that - we're just not ready yet.

Get people to test it on different OS boxes, so we can decide WHAT sizing is best. 

## Changelog

Started with Tkinter Gui, but moved to PYQT6.

Realized it needed more to it. 

Added gallery, text editing, image preview.

Text box list.

Save, Close and Select Image.

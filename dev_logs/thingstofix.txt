Gemini’s review on platform agnosticism and memory management:

Taming PyQt6: The Image Handling Battle Plan
This guide is for defeating the common performance, memory, and cross-platform gremlins that appear when building image-based apps with PyQt6.
1. The Core Problem: The Framework Tax
Your code is simple. The framework is not. PyQt6 is a powerful skyscraper; you pay for its features with memory and complexity. The goal is not to fight the framework, but to use it smartly.
2. Battle Plan: Memory & Performance
Your enemies are high RAM usage and a "janky" (unresponsive) UI. Here's how to win.
Strategy 1: Never Store the Full Image
This is the most critical rule. The high RAM usage comes from keeping uncompressed images in memory.
	•	DON'T: Have variables like self.current_image or self.current_pixmap that hold a full-resolution image.
	•	DO: Store only the file path to the image.
Generated python

class MainWindow(QtWidgets.QMainWindow):
    def __init__(self):
        # ...
        self.current_image_path = None # Store the path, not the data!



‏‭Use code with caution.‬

‭Python‬

Strategy 2: On-Demand, Scaled Loading
Load and resize the image only when you need to display it, and only load it as big as you need.
	•	The Trigger: Use the resizeEvent of your main window. This automatically fires whenever the window size changes.
	•	The Logic: Create a single function (update_display) that reads the image from the stored path, resizes it to fit the current display widget's size, and then sets it.
Generated python

# In your MainWindow class
def resizeEvent(self, event):
    """Qt automatically calls this when the window is resized."""
    super().resizeEvent(event)
    if self.current_image_path:
        self.update_displayed_image() # Redraw the image to fit the new size

def update_displayed_image(self):
    if not self.current_image_path:
        return

    # Get the current size of the QLabel where the image will go
    label_size = self.image_display_label.size()

    # Create a small, high-quality thumbnail IN MEMORY
    # The 'with' statement ensures the full-size image is released immediately
    with Image.open(self.current_image_path) as img:
        # Use ImageOps to fix rotation BEFORE you do anything else!
        img = ImageOps.exif_transpose(img)

        # Scale it down. LANCZOS is the highest quality filter.
        img.thumbnail((label_size.width(), label_size.height()), Image.Resampling.LANCZOS)

        # Convert the SMALL thumbnail to a QPixmap and display it
        pixmap = self.convert_pillow_to_qt(img) # See helper function below
        self.image_display_label.setPixmap(pixmap)



‏‭Use code with caution.‬

‭Python‬

Strategy 3: Defeating the Gremlins (Color & Rotation)
AI-generated code often gets this wrong. Here are the specific fixes.
	•	Wrong Rotation: Always use ImageOps.exif_transpose() right after opening an image. This reads the metadata and physically rotates the pixels for you.
	•	Screwy Colors (RGB vs BGR): Pillow uses RGB. Qt often prefers a different byte order. You must manually swap the Red and Blue channels during conversion.
Here's the helper function that handles the color swap:
Generated python

# A helper function in your class or a utility module
def convert_pillow_to_qt(self, pillow_image):
    """Converts a Pillow image to a QPixmap, fixing color channels."""
    img = pillow_image.copy() # Make a copy to avoid modifying the original

    # Handle the RGB/BGR channel swap
    if img.mode == "RGB":
        r, g, b = img.split()
        img = Image.merge("RGB", (b, g, r))
    elif img.mode == "RGBA":
        r, g, b, a = img.split()
        img = Image.merge("RGBA", (b, g, r, a))

    # Convert to QImage
    if img.mode == "RGBA":
        qimage = QImage(img.tobytes("raw", "RGBA"), img.width, img.height, QImage.Format.Format_ARGB32)
    else:
        qimage = QImage(img.tobytes("raw", "RGB"), img.width, img.height, QImage.Format.Format_RGB888)

    return QPixmap.fromImage(qimage)



‏‭Use code with caution.‬

‭Python‬

3. The asyncio Question: A Different Tool
asyncio is powerful, but it does not solve the UI jank from image resizing.
When asyncio MIGHT Help: I/O-Bound Tasks
asyncio is for managing tasks where you wait for something external. Use it if your app ever needs to:
	•	Fetch data from a web API (e.g., "upload this image to a server").
	•	Run a slow database query.
	•	Read/write many small files from a slow network drive.
It will NOT help with CPU-bound tasks like resizing one big image, which is your current bottleneck. Using it with PyQt also requires a "bridge" library like qasync to prevent an "event loop war."
4. Platform Agnosticism Arsenal
To make your code run anywhere without headaches, use these tools.
pathlib (The Modern Standard)
This is the best way to handle file paths. It automatically uses / or \ correctly.
	•	DON'T: my_path = 'data\\' + 'image.jpg' (Breaks on Mac/Linux)
	•	DO: Generated python  from pathlib import Path
	•	data_folder = Path("./data")
	•	my_path = data_folder / "image.jpg" # Clean, readable, and cross-platform
	•	print(my_path) # Will show data\image.jpg on Windows, data/image.jpg on Linux     ‭Use code with caution.‬  ‭Python‬     
multiprocessing.freeze_support() (The Windows Lifesaver)
This is the solution to your original problem. It's the #1 fix for GUI apps that crash on startup on Windows when run directly or packaged.
	•	Where it goes: The very first line inside the if __name__ == "__main__" block of your main entry-point script.
Generated python

# In your main script (e.g., main.py)
import multiprocessing

if __name__ == "__main__":
    multiprocessing.freeze_support() # Does nothing on Mac/Linux, essential on Windows
    main()



‏‭Use code with caution.‬

‭Python‬

platform (The Last Resort)
If you absolutely must do something different on one OS, use the platform module to check.
Generated python

import platform

if platform.system() == "Windows":
    # Do Windows-specific stuff
    pass
elif platform.system() == "Darwin": # Darwin is the core of macOS
    # Do Mac-specific stuff
    pass



‏‭Use code with caution.‬

‭Python‬


By following this plan, you move from fighting the framework to mastering it. Your app will be fast, memory-efficient, and truly platform-agnostic.

Gemini on how to fix things:

Ah, okay, this is a fantastic real-world scenario that clarifies the problem perfectly. You're not just dealing with a static dataset; you're building a tool that loads user-provided files at runtime.
The user loads an image containing a workflow (e.g., from ComfyUI or a similar tool), and that workflow's JSON metadata contains someone's API key.
This completely changes the threat model. The problem is not about "sanitizing your repository"; it's about "safely handling untrusted user input at runtime."
You are correct. You cannot pre-sanitize data you haven't seen yet. Here is the new battle plan for this specific, dynamic situation.
The "Untrusted Runtime Data" Handling Plan
Your application loads files that may contain secrets. The goal is to process the data you need while protecting both your application and your user.
The Golden Rule
Never trust user-provided data. Treat every file as potentially hostile or contaminated. Your application must be a "secure airlock"—it lets the good stuff (metadata) in while neutralizing or blocking the bad stuff (secrets, malicious code).
The Core Strategy: The "Load, Sanitize, Use" Pipeline
Every time your application reads a file, it must follow this three-step process in memory, before the data is used for anything significant or displayed to the user.
Generated code
User selects file -> [STEP 1: Load into Memory] -> [STEP 2: Sanitize in Memory] -> [STEP 3: Use the Safe Data]
Use code with caution.
Step 1: Load the Data into Memory
This part is straightforward. You open the image and extract the raw JSON/text metadata into a Python variable (e.g., a dictionary).
Generated python
from PIL import Image
import json

def extract_workflow_from_image(filepath):
    """Extracts raw, untrusted workflow data from an image."""
    try:
        with Image.open(filepath) as img:
            # This is a common way workflows are stored
            workflow_data_str = img.info.get("prompt", "{}")
            untrusted_workflow = json.loads(workflow_data_str)
            return untrusted_workflow
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error extracting workflow: {e}")
        return None
Use code with caution.
Python
Step 2: Sanitize the Data (The Crucial Airlock)
This is where you build your sanitizer function. It takes the raw, untrusted data structure and returns a "safe" version.
This function should be aggressive and paranoid.
Generated python
def sanitize_workflow_data(untrusted_data):
    """
    Recursively scans a dictionary/list structure and redacts sensitive data.
    Returns a new, sanitized copy of the data.
    """
    # List of keywords that indicate a value might be a secret. Be aggressive here.
    SENSITIVE_KEYWORDS = [
        "key", "token", "password", "secret", "auth", "bearer", "api",
        "access", "private", "pass", "credential", "license"
    ]
    REDACTION_PLACEHOLDER = "[REDACTED BY YOUR-APP-NAME]"

    if isinstance(untrusted_data, dict):
        safe_dict = {}
        for key, value in untrusted_data.items():
            # Check if the key itself suggests a secret
            is_sensitive_key = any(keyword in key.lower() for keyword in SENSITIVE_KEYWORDS)

            if is_sensitive_key:
                safe_dict[key] = REDACTION_PLACEHOLDER
            else:
                # Recursively sanitize the value
                safe_dict[key] = sanitize_workflow_data(value)
        return safe_dict

    elif isinstance(untrusted_data, list):
        # Recursively sanitize each item in the list
        return [sanitize_workflow_data(item) for item in untrusted_data]

    else:
        # It's a string, number, etc. Assume it's safe if its key wasn't sensitive.
        return untrusted_data
Use code with caution.
Python
Step 3: Use Only the Sanitized Data
Now, you integrate this into your application's logic. Your UI code should never touch the raw, untrusted data.
Generated python
# In your main application logic when a user selects a file...

def handle_file_selection(filepath):
    # STEP 1: Load raw data
    untrusted_workflow = extract_workflow_from_image(filepath)
    if not untrusted_workflow:
        # Handle error
        return

    # STEP 2: Sanitize the data in memory
    safe_workflow = sanitize_workflow_data(untrusted_workflow)

    # STEP 3: Use ONLY the safe data for display or processing
    # For example, display the sanitized JSON in a text box
    pretty_safe_json = json.dumps(safe_workflow, indent=2)
    self.workflow_display_widget.setPlainText(pretty_safe_json)

    # If you need to access parts of the workflow, use the safe version
    model_name = safe_workflow.get("model_name", "Unknown") # This is fine
    api_key_attempt = safe_workflow.get("api_key", "") # This will now return "[REDACTED...]"
Use code with caution.
Python
Why This Approach Works and is Necessary
Protects the User: If you display the full workflow data in your UI, the user might see their own key and unknowingly share a screenshot of your application, leaking their own credentials. By redacting it, you protect them from themselves.
Protects Your Application: If your application ever needs to, for example, log errors or state, you won't accidentally write someone's secret key into your log files.
No False Alarms: You are not permanently deleting data from the user's original file. You are only working with a temporary, sanitized copy in memory. The user's original image on their hard drive remains untouched.
It's a General Solution: This "load, sanitize, use" pipeline works for any kind of user-provided structured data, not just workflow images.
This is the standard security posture for any application that processes complex user-provided files: assume contamination, sanitize at the border, and operate only on the clean copy.

This is because we ran into j-son files with hugging face API keys.

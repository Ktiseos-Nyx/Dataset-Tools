"""Refactored UI Proof of Concept.

This package demonstrates a cleaner, more Pythonic architecture for the Dataset Tools UI.
This is a proof-of-concept and not intended to replace the working UI - just demonstrate
better structural patterns.

Key improvements:
- Proper OOP encapsulation (panels as classes, not procedural setup)
- Type-safe composition (real attributes, not dynamic assignment)
- Better separation of concerns (each panel manages its own logic)
- Easier to test, maintain, and extend

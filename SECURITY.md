# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As stated below until we get a hold on FINAL versioning the security updates of this are largely just based on what OLD branches exist.

There are no UPDATES to SEVERELY OLD CODE from before 2025.

Currently there's no "SECURTITY UPDATES" due to the flucation in development of this.
but moving forward:

# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As stated below until we get a hold on FINAL versioning the security updates of this are largely just based on what OLD branches exist. Currently we're trying to use 0.5 as our base branch numbering when everything was 100% solid, as in linted, and not just garbola-LLM junk. We're working on everything as we go!  

There are no UPDATES to SEVERELY OLD CODE from before 2025.

Currently there's no "SECURTITY UPDATES" due to the flucation in development of this.
but moving forward:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Main Branch  | :white_check_mark: |
| 0.55  | :white_check_mark: |
| 0.51 | :white_check_mark: |
| < OldVersions   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use the issues and discussions tabs to report things, or visit our discord. We use heavy testing, and use secure components and repositories in our work, if this fails due to a dependency issue let us know if our testing doesn't find it!
